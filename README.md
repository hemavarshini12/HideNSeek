Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within seemingly innocuous carriers, such as images, audio files, or text, to ensure the secrecy and integrity of the hidden data. This field of information security is concerned with the covert transmission of data while minimizing the chances of detection. Steganography techniques employ various methods to embed data in cover media, leveraging imperceptible alterations to the carrier that are difficult for unauthorized parties to detect. This abstract provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and applications of steganography, highlighting its importance in secure communication and data protection. It discusses the challenges in steganalysis, the process of detecting hidden information, and the need for ongoing research to advance the field's capabilities and address evolving security threats. Steganography continues to play a vital role in safeguarding sensitive information, particularly in a world where digital communication and data transmission are increasingly prevalent.
